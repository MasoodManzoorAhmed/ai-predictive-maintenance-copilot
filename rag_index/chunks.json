    "text": "Abstract— This paper describes how damage propagation can be modeled within the modules of aircraft gas turbine engines. To that end, response surfaces of all sensors are generated via a thermo-dynamical simulation model for the engine as a function of variations of flow and efficiency of the modules of interest. An exponential rate of change for flow and efficiency loss was imposed for each data set, starting at a randomly chosen initial deterioration set point. The rate of change of the flow and efficiency denotes an otherwise unspecified fault with increasingly worsening effect. The rates of change of the faults were constrained to an upper threshold but were otherwise chosen randomly. Damage propagation was allowed to continue until a failure criterion was reached. A health index was defined as the minimum of several superimposed operational margins at any given time instant and the "

In most cases real- world data contain fault signatures for a growing fault but no or little data capture fault evolution until failure. Procuring actual system fault progression data is typically time consuming and expensive. Fielded systems are, most of the time, not properly instrumented for collection of relevant data. Those fortunate enough to be able to collect long-term data for fleets of systems tend to – understandably – hold the data from public release for proprietary or competitive reasons. Few public data repositories (e.g., [1]) exist that make run-to-failure data available. The lack of common data sets, which researchers can use to compare their approaches, is impeding progress in the field of prognostics. While several forecasting co"

While several forecasting competitions have been held in the past (e.g., [2-7]), none have been conducted with a PHM-centric focus. All this provided the motivation to conduct the first PHM data challenge. The task was to estimate remaining life of an unspecified system using historical data only, irrespective of the underlying physical process. For most complex systems like aircraft engines, finding a suitable model that allows the injection of health related changes certainly is a challenge in itself. In addition, the question of how the damage propagation should be modeled within a model needed to be addressed. Secondary issues revolved around how this propagation would be manifested in sensor signatures such that users could build meaningful prognostic solutions. "

Reliably estimating remaining life holds the promise for considerable cost savings (for example by avoiding unscheduled maintenance and by increasing equipment usage) and operational safety improvements. Remaining life estimates provide decision makers with information that allows them to change operational characteristics (such as load) which in turn may prolong the life of the component. It also allows planners to account for upcoming maintenance and set in motion a logistics process that supports a smooth transition from faulty equipment to fully functional.

DAMAGE PROPAGATION MODELING Having decided on the system model, the next hurdle is to model the propagation of damage.

APPLICATION SCENARIO The scenario developed for the challenge data tracks a number of aircraft engines throughout their usage history. A particular engine unit may be employed under different flight conditions from one flight to another. Depending on various factors the amount and rate of damage accumulation will be different for each engine. It is assumed that the amount of damage accumulated during a particular flight will not be directly quantifiable solely based on flight duration and flight conditions, and hence, one mu"

This scenario models engine performance degradation due to wear and tear based on the usage pattern of the engines and not necessarily due to any particular fault mode. Therefore, sudden degradation during a flight is rather unlikely. This allows us to take one measurement snapshot per flight to characterize the engine health during or right after that flight. Further, the effects of between-flight maintenance have not been explicitly modeled but have been incorporated as the process noise. This allows the engine performance parameters (flow and efficiency) to improve within allowable limits at any point and hence the loss in efficiency or flow is not locally mo"

Noise Characterizing noise in a system may be a non-trivial undertaking. Of various sources, the main sources of noise while assessing the true state of system’s health are manufacturing and assembly variations, process noise (due to factors not taken in to account while modeling the process), and measurement noise to name a few important ones. These noise sources introduce their respective contributions at different stages of the process and a combined effect is observed in the sensor measurements at the end.

Among the margins considered, some are directly measurable, such as core speed limits and upper EGT thresholds. Others are “virtual” margins established through simulation. Each of these margins are normalized to the range [0,1], where one signifies a perfectly healthy system and zero denotes a system whose stall margin has reduced by a specified limit.

These suggestions are just to illustrate the point that there may be more modifications possible depending on specific applications and requirements and one must adapt accordingly. A comprehensive review of prognostics metrics is given in [20]. VIII. CONCLUSION This paper has described how damage propagation can be modeled in various modules of aircraft gas turbine engines for developing and testing prognostics algorithms. A publically available aero-propulsion system simulator, C- MAPSS, was used in this study. Various assumptions and settings have been provided that were used to generate data for the PHM competition at the first international conference on prognostics and health management. Although, the data for the competition consisted of a subset of various possible conditions and settings, an insight into other po"

Kanpur ABSTRACT Axial compression systems are widely used in many aerodynamic applications. However , the operability of such systems is limited at low-mass flow rates by fluid dynamic instabilities. These instabilities lead the compressor to rotating stall or surge. In some instances, a combination of rotating stall and surge, called modified surge, has also been observed. In this paper , a brief introduction to these aerodynamic instabilities has been given. The identification of instability is the most important thing so; this paper will help to distinguish between two instabilities.

A fundamentally different approach known as active surge-stall control is to use feedback to stabilize this unstable regime. An axial compressor, shown in Figure 1, consists of a row of rotor blades followed by a row of stator blades. The working fluid passes through these blades without significant change in radius. Energy is transferred to the fluid by changing its swirl, or tangential velocity , through the stage.

Compression systems can exhibit several types of instabilities: combustion instabilities, aero elastic instabilities such as flutter and finally aerodynamic flow instabilities.

The operational stability of a compression system depends on the characteristic of both the compressor and the downstream flow device. Mathematically , if the slope of compressor performance map is less than the slope of characteristic map of the throttle (points P1 and P2 shown in Figure 3a) the system is stable.

The compressor operating point thus moves closer to the compressor stall limit. The distance between the equilibrium operating line and the compressor stall limit determines the permissible acceleration and is defined as the acceleration margin.

During the normal operation of a compressor, the airflow through the compressor is essentially steady and axisymmetric in a rotating coordinate system. Rotating stall is inherently a 2-D unsteady local phenomenon in which the flow is no longer uniform in the azimuthal direction. It often takes only a few seconds for rotating stall to build up, and the compressor can operate under rotating stall for several minutes before damage develops.

In full-span stall the complete height of the annulus is stalled while in part-span rotating stall a restricted region of the blade passage is stalled. Recovery from rotating stall is often more difficult than surge. Rotating stall can also serve as the precursor to the more severe and dangerous flow stability, called surge.

We have to restart the gas turbine engine for unrecoverable stall which have many bad effects.

Gas turbine compressor fouling is a serious issue that can reduce the efficiency and performance of gas turbine engin es. The problem occurs when foreign particles, such as dust , dirt, and debris, accumulate on the blades of the compressor, causing a reduction in airflow and an increase in compressor outlet temperature. This can lead to decreased output powe r, increased fuel consumption, and shortened component life.

BACKGROUND The gas turbine operates using the Brayton thermodynamic cycle and converts the heat generated from combustion into mechanical energy. This process uti lizes air as the fluid and is made up of three main stages: 1. Compression; air is sucked into the compressor and as it is forced through the compression stage its pressure rises significantly, possibly by a factor of 30. 2. Combustion; the high-pressure air passes into the combustion stage where injectors inject a steady flow of fuel. After mixing with fuel the combustible mixtur e moves to the combustion chamber where combustion takes place. The energy from combustion increases b oth the ent"

The rotating shaft allows work to be extracted from the engine and is also used to drive the compressor and necessary external equipment. The massive ingestion of air by a gas turbine means that even if the filters reduced the contamination rate to 3ppm, the turbine could take in – on a daily basis - as much as 4.5kg of foreign material, and this shows why airborne parti cles such as sand are so important in performance deterioration.

Furthermore, maintenance costs are substantially re duced with compressor cleaning, especially when the engine is shut down.
